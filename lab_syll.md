**Attendance**: This is a laboratory course so attendance is required.
If you cannot attend the lab session because of illness or emergency,
please **call or email before class**.  There are three field trips for
this lab course.  One required field trip takes place during regularly
scheduled lab time, but will be a late return. Two **weekend field
trips** are scheduled and **attendance to one of these trips is
mandatory** (but you are encouraged to and may attend both).

**Grades**: The lab part of the course is worth 30% of your total grade.

                        Lab Worksheets                      10%

                        Lab Report:                             10%

                        Question Sets:                        5%

                        Species Reports                      5%

**Lab reports: **You will all write a lab report for the Ocean
Acidification two part lab. The **draft lab report is due on April
18/19** (your lab day). You will go through a peer review process with
reviewed papers due the next week (**reviews due April 25/26).**   The
reviews should include constructive comments on improving the report and
a “grade” (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, or Excellent). **The final lab
report is due on May 7/8**.  **All reports are due by midnight on the
due date and must be turned in via the class website dropbox.**

**Worksheets: **In each lab period you will fill out a worksheet. This
worksheet is due at the end of the lab period.

**Species report: **Each student will choose an invertebrate species to
profile.  Species profiles will consist of a website with information,
references, and pictures of the species or a youtube video including the
same information in a creative way.  More details on website
design/video will follow. **The species profile website is due on May
21/22.**  **Each student will be required to give a five minute
Powerpoint or video presentation on their species during lab May
21/22**.
